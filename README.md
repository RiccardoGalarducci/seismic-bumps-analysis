# Seismic-bumps Analysis

This repository contains the **Data Mining Fundamentals project** of my Master's degree in Data Science & Business Informatics at University of Pisa.
The aim of the project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis and perform multiple tasks on 
[Seismic-bumps dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/266/seismic+bumps).

## Description

The tasks afforded in the project are:

- Data Understanding & Preparation
- Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering) 
- Classification (Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest)
- Pattern Mining (Apriori algorithm)

## Repository Overview

In this repository, in the root level, you can find the pdf report of the project and the **\code** folder which contains the jupyter notebooks diveded for tasks afforded.
